            Hi everyone. My name is <strong>Kim Yewon</strong>. I'm studying <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110405/" target="_blank" title="HTML5">HTML</a> right now. I was thinking about what would be the best way to make it in the process of learning HTML and thought about organizing it about me.<br>So I'm taking this opportunity to build my own portfolio, organize my short life, reflect on my goals once again, and use it as a driving force for the future. It might be boring, but I'd appreciate it if you could look at it generously.
